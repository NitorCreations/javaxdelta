/**
 * A text-file format analog for GDIFF, which is only supported for binary
 * streams.
 * 
 * The output follows the following extended BNF format:
 * 
 <pre>
 gdiff-text ::= header , { copy | data }
 header ::= 'gdt' , { version } , '\n'
 copy   ::= 'y' offset ',' length '\n'
 data   ::= 'i' length '\n' text-chunk '\n'
 length ::= hex-digit , { hex-digit }
 offset ::= hex-digit , { hex-digit }
 hex-digit  ::= '0'-'9' | 'a'-'f'
 text-chunk ::= (* arbitrary text string *)
 version ::= '1'-'9'
 </pre>
 * Note that 'y' is used for copy and 'i' for data since they aren't to be 
 * confused with the hex characters 'c' and 'd'.
 * <p>
 * Note that the length of text-string is capped at {@link #CHUNK_SIZE} characters
 * for this implementation.
 * <p>
 * The initial version is 1 and is optionally indicated. Newer versions may support 
 * additional commands and hints.
 * <p>
 * See also:
