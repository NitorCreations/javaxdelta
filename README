Xdelta implemented in java

Sourceforge project link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaxdelta.

This library implements Josh MacDonalds xdelta binary diff algorithm in java.
More information on this algorithm can be found at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/xdelta.

This implementation uses the GDIFF file format for storing binary deltas. 
There is also a patcher that takes a source file and a patch file in this
format and produces the original file.

Requirements:
	Note that in "2.0" (this current release), new requirements are:

* GNU Trove 2.0 or later is required. The package now uses GNU Trove's primitive
hashtable for storing checksum information. See: 

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=39235

* JDK 1.4 is now required for runtime for binary diffs.
* JDK 1.5 is required for the com.nothome.delta.text package

TODO:
 - Possibly write stand-alone long-int hashtable
 - Paging of checksum data
 - Support JDK 1.4
